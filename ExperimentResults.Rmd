This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
data <- read.csv("/Users/Eric/Desktop/Psych254/ehermannProject/Batch_122585_batch_results.csv")
df <- data.frame(data$Answer.personalFinanceClaimScore, data$Answer.overclaimingScore, data$Answer.FLQuizScore)
plot(df$data.Answer.personalFinanceClaimScore, df$data.Answer.overclaimingScore)
data.lm = lm(formula = df$data.Answer.overclaimingScore ~ df$data.Answer.personalFinanceClaimScore, data = df)
summary(data.lm)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
